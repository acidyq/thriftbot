# ðŸ“Š ThriftBot Project Development Log

## Project Overview
**ThriftBot** is an AI-powered CLI application designed for eBay resellers to streamline the process from thrift store finds to optimized eBay listings and profit tracking.

**Stack**: Python 3.12+, Typer CLI framework, SQLite with SQLModel, Pillow for image processing, OpenAI for AI-generated copy, and various data analysis tools.

## Development Timeline

### ðŸš€ Project Initialization - October 25, 2025

#### Environment Setup
- **Working Directory**: `/Users/acydyca/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/My_Drive/windsurf_projects/thriftbot`
- **Project Structure**: Following the modular architecture outlined in `thriftbot_prompt.md`
- **Development Environment**: macOS with zsh shell

#### Key Documents Created
- âœ… `project_log.md` - This living document to track all development activities
- ðŸ“‹ `thriftbot_prompt.md` - Comprehensive project specification and requirements

#### Next Steps
Based on the prompt specifications, we need to implement:

**Phase 1: CLI MVP**
- [ ] Set up Python virtual environment
- [ ] Initialize Git repository
- [ ] Create project folder structure
- [ ] Install core dependencies (typer, sqlmodel, pillow, etc.)
- [ ] Implement basic CLI commands
- [ ] Create inventory database models
- [ ] Build photo processing capabilities
- [ ] Develop CSV export functionality
- [ ] Add price suggestion features
- [ ] **Enhanced Profit Tracking System**:
  - Item cost tracking
  - Average market price analysis (competitor research)
  - Our sale price optimization
  - eBay fees calculation (listing, final value, PayPal)
  - Net profit calculations
  - ROI percentage tracking

**Phase 2: AI Integration**
- [ ] Integrate OpenAI API for title/description generation
- [ ] Create fallback templates for when AI is unavailable
- [ ] Add configurable description styles

**Phase 3: Workflow Automation**
- [ ] Implement pipeline command (process â†’ generate â†’ price â†’ export)
- [ ] Auto-categorization features
- [ ] Condition template system

**Phase 4: Browser Automation & eBay Integration**
- [ ] Generate complete eBay listing .json files for each inventory item
- [ ] Browser automation integration (Claude/Comet Browser, ChatGPT/Atlas Browser)
- [ ] Automated eBay seller portal login and listing creation
- [ ] OAuth2 implementation for eBay Sell API (fallback)
- [ ] Draft listing creation via API
- [ ] Sold item synchronization

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **CLI Framework**: Typer chosen for its intuitive API and type hints
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLModel for local persistence and easy deployment
- **Image Processing**: Pillow + rembg for background removal and resizing
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI SDK for natural language generation

### Project Structure Philosophy
Following a modular approach where each component has a single responsibility:
- `cli.py` - Command-line interface entry point
- `db.py` - Database models and persistence layer
- `images.py` - Photo processing utilities
- `ai.py` - AI-powered content generation
- `pricing.py` - Price analysis and suggestions
- `exporters.py` - Data export functionality
- `browser_automation.py` - eBay listing JSON generation for browser agents
- `profit_tracker.py` - Comprehensive profit analysis and fee calculations

## Development Notes

### For Beginners
This project demonstrates several key software development concepts:

1. **Modular Design**: Breaking functionality into separate, focused modules
2. **CLI Development**: Using modern Python tools like Typer for command-line interfaces
3. **Database Integration**: Local data persistence with SQLite
4. **API Integration**: Working with external services (OpenAI, eBay)
5. **Image Processing**: Automated photo enhancement for e-commerce
6. **Data Export**: Generating CSV files compatible with eBay's bulk upload

### Development Best Practices Applied
- Virtual environment isolation
- Git version control
- Comprehensive documentation
- Phase-based development approach
- Clear separation of concerns
